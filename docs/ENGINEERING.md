## How it works

Qwen3.8-Flash-Next is a *mixture-of-experts* model: each token uses only a
small subset of its expert networks. Most of its storage is 68 GB of routed
experts and a 32 GB n-gram lookup table. The 3.8 GB shared part stays in RAM.

slotstream reads experts from SSD into a fixed pool of cache slots. All
48 layers share that pool, so layers that need more slots can borrow them
from others. Keeping more experts in RAM reduces disk reads. It changes
speed without changing the expert weights used in the computation.

A memory-mapped file alone doesn't solve this in MLX, Apple's machine-learning
framework. The tested expert-gather operation materialized every expert in a
layer, even though the token needed only a few. Explicit slots keep those
reads and allocations under control. The [design](../PLAN.md) covers the details.

That design targets Macs that cannot hold the model, 16 to 64 GB. On 96 GB
and larger Macs the model fits in memory, and the streaming machinery is
overhead that an engine keeping the model resident does not pay; see
[related projects](#related-projects) and [who it's for](../README.md#who-its-for).

## Native stack

Slotstream is Swift from the command line down to the GPU. No interpreter
runs on the request path.

| Layer | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Command-line tool, HTTP server, the OpenAI-, Ollama- and Responses-compatible endpoints and the fx gateway | Swift: `Sources/slotstream-cli`, `Sources/Slotstream/Server.swift` and the dialect files beside it |
| Memory planner, expert store and slot cache, governor, sampler, speculative decode, prefix cache | Swift: `Sources/Slotstream` |
| Tensor operations | [mlx-swift](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift), Apple's MLX, with its prebuilt `mlx.metallib` beside the binary |
| Gated-delta recurrence, selected attention, partial rotation, block and router selection | Slotstream's own Metal kernels, compiled at run time through `MLXFast.metalKernel` |
| Tokenizer | [swift-transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/swift-transformers) |
| Slotpack download decoder | C, `Sources/CSlotpack`, with no external codec |
| Expert and n-gram reads | `pread` into a fixed slot pool over parallel lanes, with lane counts chosen by measurement |

The Python under `Tools/` never runs in the product. It is the reference
implementation the Swift port is checked against layer by layer, the numpy
sampler oracle, the trace simulators and benchmark drivers, the model-free
gates and the release checks. The [testing guide](TESTING.md) lists them.

The stack is native on purpose. The engine exists for one model on one kind
of hardware, and each layer is tuned for the layer below it: expert records
are read from the SSD into the slots the GPU computes from, process memory is
accounted from real CPU and GPU allocations, and the governor resizes the
cache under memory pressure. The same design ships as one binary, installs
with one command and can be called in process from a Mac app; the
[Swift library](LIBRARY.md) and the [Sevra Mac notes](SEVRA-MAC.md) describe
that use.

What the native stack does not claim: the measured gains on this page come
from the mechanisms named with them, the decode lookahead, the corrected
expert forecast, speculative decoding, the prefix cache, the GPU keepalive and
direct demand reads. Warm decode is
dominated by SSD reads and GPU waits, so the work goes to fewer reads and
more overlap rather than host-side micro-optimization
([decision](../db/records/decisions/decode-host-time-is-waiting-not-graph-construction.md)).
The engine runs only on Apple Silicon, and there is no completed same-Mac
comparison with other engines; see [related projects](#related-projects).

## Speed

On the 48 GB M5 Pro:

| Measurement | Result |
|---|---|
| Reply generation after the cache warms up | ~12 tok/s |
| Reply generation with speculative decoding and the 0.2.16 decode lookahead, 20 GB target | 13.47 tok/s, 1.11x faster than without the lookahead |
| Reply generation with the 0.2.19 corrected forecast, 22 GB controlled benchmark (smaller prompt passes, prefix caching off) | 15.86 tok/s, 1.10x faster than the 0.2.18 forecast |
| Engine load in the original experiment, before processing the prompt | ~2 s (historical) |
| Planned memory with automatic sizing | 32 GB (estimate) |

That memory figure is the historical planner estimate, not a measurement of
the corrected kernel lifetime peak. Older reported values can miss GPU memory
freed before the observation. Current usage, lifetime peaks and request samples
are explained in the [memory controls](CLI.md#memory-options).
The engine-load timing also comes from an early measurement; it excludes the
current CLI's full weight-verification step and is not a current cold-start
or first-answer estimate.

**Long prompts take time before the first reply token.** Processing the prompt
is called *prefill*. The estimates for this Mac are about 9 s for 2,000 tokens
and 39 s for 8,000. Ordinary prose can take longer than the synthetic prompt
used by the estimator. `slotstream doctor` shows estimates for your memory
plan, and the terminal prints progress during long prompts.

The conversation cache avoids processing unchanged history again. In a
historical eight-turn test at a 16 GB target, the last turn started replying
after 6.0 s with reuse, compared with 25.8 s without it. The current aligned
cache accepts only checkpoints compatible with the incoming prompt's compute
passes and backend, preserving exact cached-versus-fresh results for that
computation. Use `--no-prefix-cache` to measure the cost of processing the
whole prompt. See the [current reuse qualification](../db/records/measurements/prompt-speed-qualification-2026-09-21.md)
for checkpoint and app-restart evidence.

### Prefill and speculative decode measurements

The prefill sweep groups work by expert and reads weights in contiguous
batches. On the development Mac, at a 16 GB memory target, an 8,000-token
prompt improved from 91 → 184 tok/s and prose from 66 → 140 tok/s. At the
8.1 GB floor, prefill improved from 51 → 93 tok/s. The planner estimates
about 220 tok/s for a 4,096-token pass on the M5 Pro. These results depend on
the prompt and configuration; they aren't measurements on a 16 GB Mac.

Speculative decode uses a small draft head to propose tokens for the main
model to verify. The current operating choice is two drafts (default 2).
The [adoption decision](../db/records/decisions/draft-depth-defaults-to-two.md)
records the workload tradeoff and the limits of the recent comparison.
In the historical one-draft test, the draft was accepted 86% of the time.
At a 28 GB memory target, that one-draft configuration improved greedy decode
by ×1.24 (10.3 → 12.8 tok/s); the improvement was ×1.18 with default server
sampling.

`--mtp auto` enables this when the expert cache can still hold 28 experts per
layer after the head's charge, before the separate lookahead reservation, a
12 GB target at the 32,768-token window. Availability and context can change
activation. The head's 512 experts are 1.42 GB of its 1.47 GB. On a cache of
76 experts per layer or more after the full 1.6 GB charge they stay resident.
Below that the head reads them from the SSD through a 64-expert cache of its
own, a 0.4 GB charge, and the main cache keeps the other 1.2 GB. A draft row
routes to ten experts; about half are already in that cache. At a 12 GB
target this made the head 1.23x faster than plain decode with the lookahead,
where a resident head only tied, and the head now runs on 24 GB Macs. The
floor was 120 until 0.2.16 and 76 until now; on 0.2.14, two drafts decoded
31.7% faster than plain decode on the same memory at 76 per layer. The
automatic ceiling is 34.6 GB with the head enabled at the 32,768-token window;
larger windows add their context charges. `--mtp off` disables the head.

With the head on, 0.2.16 also runs the decode lookahead, and without the head
it now runs in plain decode too, where it made plain decode 1.11x faster at a
10 GB target. After each layer, the
router of the layer two ahead runs on the current hidden state, and the experts
it picks are read from the SSD straight into cache slots before that layer asks
for them. FP32 copies of the router weights save a conversion on every routing
call, and the GPU is drained every four layers instead of every layer, with
each forecast riding the next routing readback. On twelve held-out prompts at a
20 GB target with two drafts, decode was 1.11x faster than the previous default
(11.79 to 13.47 tok/s median) with identical output. In separate attribution
runs on the tuning prompts, the router copies and fewer drains added
about 2% each over prefetch alone. Those component results are specific to
that workload and are not separate held-out speedups. The
[decision](../db/records/decisions/decode-lookahead-default-with-the-draft-head.md)
records its 373 MiB charge, overrides and limits.
The short [expert lookahead guide](EXPERT-LOOKAHEAD.md) explains the mechanism
and the experiments that led to it.

### GPU keepalive and direct demand reads

Streamed decode is stop-and-go. At every layer the host reads the routing
back, reads the experts the cache is missing and only then submits the next
burst of GPU work, so a one-token pass is a few hundred short command buffers
with the GPU idle in between. An idle Apple GPU lowers its clock and starts
the next buffer late. While a request generates, Slotstream now keeps the GPU
busy with a one-thread kernel on its own command queue. The kernel computes
nothing and touches no model memory, so outputs are unchanged.

Cache misses used to be read into staging arrays and then scattered into the
cache on the GPU, one more dispatch and wait per layer. They are now read into
host memory and copied straight into their cache slots: the same bytes in the
same place, without the scatter.

On the development Mac, paired and interleaved with identical output, the two
together made decode 1.28x faster at a 10 GB target without the draft head
and 1.22x faster at 22 GB with the draft head and lookahead, counting only
pairs with no swap activity. The keepalive costs power: energy per generated
token rose 7% at 16 GB, so `--gpu-keepalive auto`, the default, runs it only
on AC power outside Low Power Mode. `--gpu-keepalive off` and
`SLOTSTREAM_OPT_DIRECT_DEMAND=0` restore the previous behavior. The
[measurement](../db/records/measurements/decode-perf-2026-09-24.md) has every
comparison, both screens and the ideas that did not help.

[MEASUREMENTS.md](../MEASUREMENTS.md) includes the configurations, comparisons,
and failed experiments behind these results.

## Context

**Prompt, conversation history, images, and reply share one window, which auto
picks for each Mac.** It takes the largest of 32,768, 65,536, 131,072 and
262,144 tokens that keeps speculative decoding as the 32,768-token plan has
it, including a draft head's resident experts, retains one complete
conversation and adds at most 10% to the planner's estimate for a typical
request. A flat estimate beyond its measured cache range is not evidence that
extra cache has no value: auto declines reductions in that range and reports
their cost as unmeasured. The same rule applies to a busy startup.
`serve --max-context 65536` fixes the window Hermes uses, and any size
up to the pinned model's 262,144 tokens is accepted; requests with images stay
within 65,536. The planner charges extra state and transient memory before
allocating the expert cache, and the automatic ceiling rises by the window's own
charge. Native runs on the development Mac cover 65,536 tokens and, since
0.2.17, 131,072 tokens with and without the draft head, both inside their memory
plans; 262,144 tokens is planned from the same ledger without a native run. The
long-context qualification is a capacity and memory check, not a long-context
answer-quality benchmark.

At 32,768 tokens, the estimated wait before the first token is about 3.0 min for
the 48 GB M5 Pro plan and 6.4 min for the 16 GB plan. The latter comes from
the M5 Pro's curve; a slower SSD can take longer. Follow-up turns reuse
unchanged history while it remains cached.

The main sequence cache uses about 27 KiB per allocated token of capacity,
rounded to allocation steps. Recurrent state, retained conversations, draft
state and transient workspace are additional charges, so this is not the
whole process cost per input token. Long prompts also cost processing time.
Slotstream reduces the prefill batch size as context grows to keep temporary
memory within the measured range.

To measure a long prompt on your Mac, stop any running server, then run:

```bash
slotstream context-check --tokens 16384
```

It reports time, speed, and peak memory, checking available memory between
passes. `slotstream prefill-schedule --chunk 4096 --tokens 32768` shows the
batch schedule without loading the model.

## Memory

Memory defaults follow the [measured operating policies](../db/records/design/measured-operating-policies.md).
That contract distinguishes model facts, safety and qualification limits,
operating defaults, and bounded estimates. Tuning choices carry evidence,
scope and revision criteria; maintaining those choices is part of the engine.

By default, slotstream chooses a memory target for your Mac and prints it at
startup. It takes the lowest of 33 GB, 70% of RAM, and 2 GB below the Metal
working-set limit, then reduces that target if other apps are using memory.
The draft head raises the base ceiling to 34.6 GB at the 32,768-token window;
the larger windows auto picks on bigger Macs add their context charges. See [Speed](#speed).

The 33 GB ceiling is a conservative default based on development-Mac
measurements. Those tests showed diminishing speed gains as
the expert cache grew. This supports a conservative default; it does not
establish an optimum for every Mac or workload. We'll adjust the default as
real measurements show a better tradeoff. The historical larger-target sweep
inspected planner estimates, which hold flat beyond the verified cache sizes;
it was not a benchmark of those larger allocations. See the
[cache measurements](../db/records/measurements/warm-decode-re-anchored-and-the-live-governor-finally-observed-2026-08.md)
and [sizing interpretation](../db/records/measurements/automatic-memory-default-evidence-scope-2026-09-09.md).

The [community M5 Max cache sweep](HARDWARE.md#does-more-memory-help) reports
faster replies with larger manual targets on the same machine. Auto has not
been calibrated to that hardware, and its fixed ceiling must not be read as
the maximum useful allocation.

The chip and SSD still matter. The plan uses decimal GB, so a Mac sold as
48 GB appears as about 52 GB in its device line.

While the server runs, it checks memory pressure every 15 s and resizes its
cache between requests. It gives memory back under pressure and grows again
when space is available. The cache-size and resize gates check byte-identical
greedy output with the other generation settings fixed. Changing the total
memory target can also change prefill grouping or enable speculative decoding;
those are separate changes, not part of that equality claim.

Warm growth also needs room for temporary replacement tensors. The governor
checks this extra allocation against both the process target and current
system availability. If it cannot fit, the existing warm cache stays usable
and growth waits. The copy preserves slot positions and appends capacity one
tensor at a time, without gathering another copy of all occupied slots.

To set a memory target yourself:

```bash
slotstream doctor --memory-gb 16
slotstream serve --memory-gb 16
```

`--memory-gb` sets the total process target, with a minimum of 8.1 GB for the
default text context; larger windows and resident components need more room.
An explicit target disables automatic cache resizing, while loading and
request-memory safeguards remain active. Preview it before starting.
The development version also offers `--memory-limit-gb`: an upper process
budget with automatic cache resizing. It can exceed the default model ceiling
while remaining bounded by supported GPU/system headroom and live memory.
The chosen limit is retained across shrink and recovery. Diagnostics and
budgeted startup share the same feasibility check.
See the [memory options](CLI.md#memory-options)
for the other controls and their precedence.

## Status and limits

- **Hardware:** the development measurements use a 48 GB M5 Pro. Community
  reports cover other Macs; several memory tiers remain estimates. See
  [Hardware measurements](HARDWARE.md).
- **Concurrency:** one model process per user, with one generation at a time.
- **Compatibility:** macOS 14/15 runtime testing is still needed. Tool calling
  works through OpenAI chat completions and the fx gateway; the Ollama subset
  doesn't support it.
- **Vision:** the image encoder is checked against an independent reference
  and the APIs are tested with images. There is no general vision accuracy
  benchmark or comparison with another runtime yet.

## Why this exists

I have a 48 GB MacBook Pro and wanted to run this model on it. The stock loader
pushed the machine into 48 GB of swap before producing a token. I built
slotstream to keep the shared weights in memory and stream the experts from
SSD, with a cache that leaves room for other apps. That is still the target:
Macs that cannot hold the model, 16 to 64 GB.

The [measurements](../MEASUREMENTS.md#m07--the-naive-path-fails-why-slotstream-exists)
start with that failed load. The launch was also
[discussed on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=49524447), with
227 points and 114 comments, reaching No. 1 on Show HN and No. 8 on the front
page on September 1, 2026.

## Related projects

If your Mac holds the whole model, 96 GB and up, an engine that keeps it in
memory is the faster choice. [MTPLX](https://github.com/youssofal/MTPLX) runs
this model with native speculative decoding on such Macs and publishes its
measurements. Slotstream is built for the Macs below that line; see
[Who it's for](../README.md#who-its-for).

There isn't a completed comparison on the same Mac yet. Each project's
reported speeds use its own setup and shouldn't be read as a ranking.

## Star history

The [README](../README.md#star-history) shows the star count and history.
The chart is updated weekly by this repository's
[workflow](../.github/workflows/star-history.yml).

## Image memory and measurements

Each resized image uses up to 2,304 tokens of the conversation's context.
The image encoder, or *vision tower*, loads on the first image and reserves
0.9 GB inside an auto or `--memory-gb` process target, reducing expert capacity
as needed. An explicit pool-size setting retains its pool and adds the tower
to the expected footprint. Image pixels and attention also need workspace;
the server rejects the request if the budget or real headroom is insufficient.
Use `slotstream serve --vision off` to disable images.

In a measured conversation, the first image turn took 15.4 s and the
follow-up took 1.8 s because its image state was reused. This tests the image
path and reuse; the project has not measured general image-answer accuracy.
