// swift-tools-version: 6.0
import PackageDescription

// Two library products and one executable. `Slotstream` is what an app imports:
// load, plan, chat, status, serve. `SlotstreamDiagnostics` is what the CLI, the
// check runner and CI import: checks, goldens, benches and parity rigs, which
// have no place in a product surface. The executable product keeps the name
// `slotstream` (the target is `slotstream-cli`) so the binary, its install path
// and its release artifact are unchanged.
