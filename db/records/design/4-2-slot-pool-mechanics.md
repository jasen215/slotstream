> **Measured 2026-08-28 — the slot pool is mandatory, not an optimisation.**
> MLX has no sparse-materialisation path out of a memory-mapped tensor:
> `mx.gather_qmm` with top-10 indices materialises **all 512 experts of the layer**
> (471.9 MB for one projection → ~68 GB across the model), and a 16-row `mx.take`

- One **global pool across layers** (all experts share the shape 3×2560×640): quantized
  weight/scales/biases tensors sized `[S, …]`; per layer, router output ids are mapped
  through the slot table → `gatherQMM(x, pool…, rhs_indices: slots)`. Misses trigger IO;
  the token's active slots are pinned until the step completes.
- Eviction: start with CLOCK + frequency byte (approximates LFU-with-decay); simulator
  (M1) also scores LRU and W-TinyLFU on real traces — cheapest adequate policy wins.
- Slot fill v0: staging buffer → sliced write into the quantized pool arrays (they're
  plain uint32/fp16 tensors; a 2.76 MB device copy is ~µs against memcpy bandwidth).
  v1 option if profiling demands: pread directly into the pool's MTLBuffer contents
  (shared storage mode on Apple Silicon needs no sync) — measure before adopting.
- Resizing: default is a **single pool** — `gatherQMM` gathers within one tensor, and
  sharding the pool would put per-segment dispatch on the hot path. Governor shrink/grow
  = rebuild the pool at the new size (rare event, costs seconds, keeps the hot path
  clean). A segmented variant is adopted only if microbenching shows per-segment
  dispatch overhead is negligible.
- **M3-entry gate — the slot-write microbench (before any streaming work):** prove that
  scattered writes into the quantized pool tensors execute in place (MLX buffer donation
  — no full-pool copy per update) and sustain > 5 GB/s of slot fills. If MLX's
  functional-update semantics force copies at this size, switch to preads directly into
  the pool's MTLBuffer contents (shared storage mode needs no sync on Apple Silicon).


Warm growth now preserves slot positions and appends zeroed capacity one tensor piece at a time. It does not gather a full extra copy of occupied rows. The live governor checks the peak replacement-plus-tail allocation, including already grown pieces, against the current process footprint, requested target and actual system headroom before starting. If temporary growth does not fit, it keeps the current warm cache and retries later. This may leave a small amount of usable final-size capacity unclaimed; it avoids a transient overshoot to gain it. Shrink retains its free-before-allocation behavior. Evidence and revision scope: [[records/measurements/sevra-app-optimizations-2026-09-23]].
