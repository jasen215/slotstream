Reported by `@waterliu1981` in [issue #6](https://github.com/carloslfu/slotstream/issues/6).
The original report and its follow-up are preserved in
[[sources/community/2026/09/2026-09-03-macbook-pro-m5-max-128gb-waterliu1981]].

MacBook Pro 16-inch (Mac17,7), M5 Max, 128 GB, internal 2 TB SSD,
macOS 26.6.2. The reporter described an idle machine. The auto plan was
34.6 GB with about 152 experts per layer and speculative decoding enabled.

The first report used Slotstream 0.2.1 and summarized warm decode at about
19 to 21 tok/s. The same author then remeasured with Slotstream 0.2.3,
reporting a checksum-verified binary replacement and unchanged weights.
That [follow-up](https://github.com/carloslfu/slotstream/issues/6#issuecomment-5520489176)
is the source of the current hardware row:

| Repeated 256-token request | Reply speed |
|---|---|
| 1 | 21.02 tok/s |
| 2 | 21.53 tok/s |
| 3 | 22.11 tok/s |

The report summarizes this as **21–22 tok/s** with the auto plan and
speculative decoding. Two longer warm runs returned 22.83 and 22.10 tok/s.
The current surface uses the reported range instead of a best run.

The report's prefill and peak figures were planner estimates, not measured
long-prompt speed or process RSS. Keep both columns unmeasured. The manual
cache-size sweep is reported separately below so its gains are visible
without attributing them to automatic sizing.

This is one community report, not an independent rerun or a comparison made
under the same conditions as the M5 Pro and M2 measurements. It supports a
machine-specific row, not a promise for all Macs with that memory capacity.

## Larger-cache results surfaced on 2026-09-13

Rechecked issue #6 and its follow-up through the live GitHub API on
2026-09-13. The existing immutable source already preserves the complete
sweep. The public tables had retained only auto, omitting evidence that more
allocated memory helped on this same machine.

| Total-process target | Experts per layer, as reported | Slotstream 0.2.3 warm decode |
|---|---|---|
| 34.6 GB (auto) | ~152 | ~21–22 tok/s |
| 48 GB (manual) | ~253 | ~26.9 tok/s |
| 73 GB (manual) | ~401–441 | ~31.5 tok/s |

All rows are the same 128 GB M5 Max, internal 2 TB SSD, with speculative
decoding enabled. Targets are decimal GB budgets, not observed peaks or
requirements for installed memory. Preserve the reporter's approximate
expert-count range rather than replace it with today's planner output.
The original 0.2.1 sweep also reported gains at larger targets; the current
public comparison uses only the follow-up's 0.2.3 values.

This within-machine comparison is evidence of a benefit from increasing the
memory target, beyond the different-chip comparison against the M5 Pro.
The manual rows are approximate summaries without the individual repeated
request timings supplied for auto. They are not an independently reproduced,
interleaved benchmark or a universal throughput curve. No new process-memory,
long-context, correctness, or 0.2.16 performance qualification is established.
Do not multiply these figures by the development Mac's later release speedup.

The README's earlier flat 13.5 tok/s values extrapolated the *scope* of a
20 GB-target development-Mac measurement while holding its numerical value
constant. Replace them with named measured configurations and explicit gaps.
Retaining the conservative automatic target does not negate this community
result or establish an optimum on larger Macs.
