# slotstream build. SwiftPM cannot compile the Metal shaders (mlx-swift
# limitation), so the prebuilt metallib matching the vendored MLX version
# (0.32.2, fetched from the mlx-metal PyPI wheel) is colocated with the binary.
#
# "Colocated" means the directory of the executable that is running: MLX finds
# it with dladdr on its own code. That is why every executable which touches
# MLX — the CLI and the check runner alike — needs its own copy beside it, and
# why a test bundle would need one in its .xctest/Contents/MacOS.
